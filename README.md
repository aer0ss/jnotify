This is a copy of upstream's [jnotify](http://jnotify.sourceforge.net).

CVS sucks, so I'm taking a snapshot (version 0.94) and building from there.
Since there's been like one patch in the past three years, I'm not really
worried about diverging much from upstream.

I'll be adding a qmake-based build system, since upstream has a weird set
of makefiles that don't use VS on Windows.
